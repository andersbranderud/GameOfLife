Game of Life
Total: 1h 55min

AI usage:
Some auto-code gen for input validations.
Auto-complete of a couple of methods, including GetValuesOfNeighbours -- to autofill 8 directions based on my first example.
Several of the unit tests.

Potential extensions if more time:
-Be able to choose symbol for the pattern.
-When entering input for the program: Be able to give a start index for a sub-pattern, e.g. width: 10, length: 10, start-index: 5, sub-pattern: 110011100; and then program will fill rest of the pattern with zeroes.

2h 35m
Extra as I needed to complete it.

AI usage: 
MapUtility read from file.
Auto-complete of a couple of methods, e.g. CheckUserInputAndUpdateDirectionl.
Most of the unit tests as not enough time otherwise.
